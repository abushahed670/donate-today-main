            <h2>to save flood victims in Sylhet region</h2>
            <p id="banner-description">Most of the Sylhet city has also gone under water. People’s lives have become
                disrupted due to
                poweroutages in the city. The flight operati Sylhet Osmani International Airport has been suspended. The
                Sylhet region has become flooded for the second time within a week. Not only Sylhet, but the water level
                of rivers of neighbouring districts are also flowing above the danger level. Kurigram and vast stretches
                of the Southern part of the country have also submerged as water surged in the Teesta. Districts of
                thecentral region are also at risk of flood.</p>

            <p>The government has to take further preparation to fight the flood. If necessary, different forces have to
                be engaged in rescue operations in full force. Rescuing stranded people is the most important work right
                now. Helicopters have to be used where road and river connection is snapped. Army has already been
                deployed in Sunamganj and they are also working on fixing the submerged power station in Sylhet.</p>

        <h1>Our Donate Plan</h1>
        <p>Along with carrying out evacuation work, relief goods should be sent to the affected areas soon. Dry food
            needs to be served to the victims. Concerned authorities must work to prevent breaking out diseases in
            relief centres. Air connectivity with Sylhet needs to be resumed in the shortest possible time. Political
            leaders and people’s representatives must come forward in this crisis moment. Non-Government Organisations
            working in the country can be attached to the rescue and relief activities.</p>
