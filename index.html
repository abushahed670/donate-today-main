            <h2>to save flood victims in Sylhet region</h2>
            <p>Most of the Sylhet city has also gone under water. Peopleâ€™s lives have become disrupted due to
                poweroutages in the city. The flight operati Sylhet Osmani International Airport has been suspended. The
                Sylhet region has become flooded for the second time within a week. Not only Sylhet, but the water level
                of rivers of neighbouring districts are also flowing above the danger level. Kurigram and vast stretches
                of the Southern part of the country have also submerged as water surged in the Teesta. Districts of
                thecentral region are also at risk of flood.</p>
